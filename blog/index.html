    <b>A story about old PC's, selfhosting and Discord bots</b>
    <p>For the last year or so, I've been working on and off to refurbish an old PC I found in my house. It's been a fun time, and I plan to soon move away from Neocities and host this website on there as well as a media server for movies and a few discord bots.<br> <a href = "./oldpcsaga">Read more...</a></p>

    <b>Let's Talk with Virgil</b>
    <p>Every now and then, I write a brief explanation on something I've found interesting, or something I feel is worth talking about. I do have a tendency to ramble, but find it helpful to lay my thoughts out without worrying about a 250-character limit.<br><a href="./lets-talk">Read more...</a><br>

    <b>A short story about Discord bots and learning to code.</b>
    <p>This one isn't actually much of a story, but there we go. I've been working on a number of single-purpose discord bots to help learn to code, with varying results. I'll merge them sooner or later, but that takes energy I rarely have spare.</p><a href = "./lgbta_news">Read more...</a>

    <b>A story about filming, inspiration and executive dysfunction</b>
    <p>Which should explain why none of these posts are finished. And why, despite enjoying filmmaking, I almost never make any films. It's gonna be a weird one, but worth a read. Hopefully.</p><a href = "./filmmaking">Read more...</a>
