      <p>So. A couple weeks ago, there was some drama going on with the mysterious admin of a certain instagram account. This account let anyone submit things relating to the school the admin and followers went to, and often this would lead to people looking for someone's details because this someone was cute, or simply calling out the sheer state of the school and its management. Because it was, and still is, in a state.<br><br>
        Now for reasons I'm not sure of, the mysterious admin of this account would pick and choose which submissions they would release. Last time I checked, they had 590 submissions and only 340 posts, which is a fairly big gap. They've also been inactive for, as of writing this, three or four days. Some drama started over this, including the mystery admin putting very passive-aggressive comments in the descriptions of their posts and generally denying that they did anything wrong. A lot of people disagreed, thinking that the admin did do something wrong. This is probably because the people wanted <i>all</i> the submissions to be shown. 
        <br><br></p><b class = minor>TW for LGBT-phobia, racism and school shootings</b>
        <p>This is where the second anon-submission account comes in, which was made specifically in protest against the first one. This new account promised that every submission would be posted, regardless of content. Given the title of this post, you can probably tell where this is going. (The second account, who I'll call V2 from now on, currently has a backlog of roughly ten posts, and hasn't been active for a few days.) So V2 went on a pretty massive trip earlier this week (17. dec 22) and posted a couple things about how "Oh my god LGBTABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP+ people exist :skull: :skull:" and "The alt kids in this school are probably gonna do a school shooting soon", which is..... questionable content at best. A few people in V2's tellonym then followed suit, some going as far as calling for the deaths of queer people, or calling for any non-white students to be expelled.</p>
        <br> <br> <b>I'm not impressed.</b>
        <p>This is not what I would like to see from a school at this level, and especially not in 2022 - almost 2023 - from people who could inform themselves on this within <i>seconds.</i> Everyone in this school has access to google, is able to search up some resources and do some reading. Everyone in this school has the brainpower to comprehend that maybe, just <i>maybe</i>, a boy doesn't want to kiss a girl, or a girl doesn't want to kiss a boy, or someone doesn't like being called a boy or a girl. Come on, people.</p><br><b>It's not that hard. Do better.</b><br><br>
        <p>By now, you're probably wondering where the pride pins come into play. So let me explain.<br>
        As I write this, there's about three hours until the first of three christmas concerts. Probably the best possible time to make a statement, as the entire school watches on. One of the groups that's performing asked if anyone had pride pins, and after not getting an answer until literally yesterday evening, I stepped up to make a handful for them. This ended up being the most stressful morning I had in a while, making pins from impractically small circles in cardboard-y photo paper. But, it was worth it. Definitely. 
        <br><br>So one of the music groups is going to be wearing my pins now, in front of the school, where everyone can see the LGBTA+ have their support. And while this not seem like much, I don't think it's time to lose hope yet - It's incredibly likely that this small act sparks even more support, and then more, and then queer people can once again walk these halls without the fear of getting hatecrimed. It's a noble goal, and it's a long shot, but it's so worth it. And hey, I'm down for the ride.<br><br>

        Depending on interest, I might make another run of pins and/or stickers. Email me if that's something you'd want.
