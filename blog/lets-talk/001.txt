<h2><b>Let's Talk: Why do repairs suck now? (#001)</b></h2><br><br>

This is something I've been noticing for a while, and it doesn't just apply to tech as you think of it: Back in the 50s-70s, things you buy were built to last. If you bought a mixer, a washing machine, a car, anything like that, you could expect them all to last you at least 15, if not 20 years. And that was -- adjusted for inflation -- for roughly the <a href="https://fiftiesweb.com/pop/prices-1950/">same price</a> as the same items today. Of course, if you were to buy a car today, you'd probably factor in that you'll find yourself buying another in 5-10 years, and that you're paying the same as in the 1950s while making comparatively less money. To add on top of that: Things tend to break down a lot quicker. Manufacturing has gotten cheaper, but it isn't cheap enough -- lots of companies have not only outsourced most of their production to cheaper areas but also reduced the quality of their products, because it costs them less to make and they last just long enough to be out of warranty when they break. Less and less do you buy a washing machine that can last for decades, and more and more do you find yourself either fixing it yourself (which is also getting harder) or simply scrapping it and getting a new one. <br><br>When stuff breaks, it's also getting a lot harder to fix it. If we dial back to the 50s, most people knew how to do pretty basic practical things -- soldering, changing a plug, light fixtures, the sorta around-the-house things that do need doing every few years. DIY as a concept <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=DIY%2Cdo+it+yourself&year_start=1900&year_end=2019&corpus=en-2019&smoothing=0&case_insensitive=true">didn't really exist</a> before the 60s because fixing stuff was common knowledge before then. Most people either knew how to fix a car's engine, or a lightbulb, or a washing machine, or simply didn't need to because, again, things were built to last. It's also worth noting that the amount of repair shops -- which could take anything and fix it up as good as new, or sometimes even better -- has gone down a lot in the last few years as well. That's largely because while tech has increased, and general knowledge of tech with it, things are a lot harder to repair now than they were. <br><br><b>So why did this change?</b><br><br>There are a few options, and I'll let you take your pick -- mix and match between these, or feel free to invent your own. The first is obviously that we as a civilisation don't value products that last for decades anymore. We are all consumers, and 21st-century consumerism is subconsciously forcing all of us to keep rebuying the newer models, regardless if the older ones could still work. (case study: apple) <br><br>What this means is that products don't really need to be built to last, because you're going to be throwing away the old ones after a year or two. Maybe longer in some cases, but you get the idea. This, of course, opens the question of exactly why the levels of consumerism we're at today exist, but I'll let you have a think on that one. <br><br>Another option is simply that constant replacements make the producers more money. If you are able to take your broken things to an independent shop and have them fixed, the producers aren't profiting, meaning the process of buying something is reduced to exactly that -- You buy an item, and that's the only time a company will ever see you. You fix it yourself, you have everything you need, so the company never sees you (or more importantly, your wallet) again. At least until you go back after like a decade. The constant need for replacement, as well as "licensed" service providers, are a fix for this problem: You buy the item, but what you're really buying is permission to use it until it breaks and you need to go back to the company you bought it from to get it fixed.<br> <br>The final option I'd like to put down is less malicious -- If it's cheaper to produce stuff for a shorter lifespan, and ship them in en masse, it is naturally a wiser decision as a business to do that. If it works well for the two years it works for, people will be coming back to you anyways to get the next round or just more of the same thing. <br><br>That all being said, I'd like to go back to what I think is the most likely option, and ask you a question: <b>In 2024, with the state of product quality and repairs, do you really 'buy' anything? Or is everything on a permanent loan, with recurring and ever-increasing costs to the producer?</b>
