<h2><b>Let's Talk: What does 'real politics' even mean? (#002)</h2></b><br><br>I first wrote this one when I was trying to get the concept of today's Progressive Party off the ground. There's at lot that changed since then, and I'm not involved with Prog anymore, but I figure this story is still worth telling.<br><br>Back when we'd just settled on a few policy plans to get going on, we were looking for a slogan for our first social media push. The push itself didn't go very well, and while that's a story for another day, we did gain a fair few slogan ideas between the trauma and whatnot. One of them, something I put down, was <b>Real politics, for Real people. </b><br><br>The principle of doing real politics has been something I've been trying to stick to since becoming one of the first campaign members. It's something I've learnt to expect from most elected officials, and also EP members, and some of you may know how I feel when people forget to keep to a decent standard.. That being said, it's hard to keep to something if you don't understand what it is you're keeping to, so I figured I'd use today's talk to outline exactly what I see under the concept of Real Politics. <br><br><b>Listen to people, and understand their concerns.</b> This includes people you don't agree with. If someone you're talking to has a different perspective, but is explaining it respectfully, I'd expect that you take the time to listen to them and understand why they might think that. Even if you do dismiss it as "another evangelical" or "another red-state cultist" later, you at least understand why you made that assessment and are able to defend it in front of others. <br><br><b>Be ready for things to not go how you want. </b>For some of you, this may be a bit rich coming from me -- me, who not only threatened to leave the party but was also threatened to be removed only a few weeks after -- but not only was the person causing all this removed, but I'd like to think there's been a bit of character development since then. Apart from understanding, a big part of politics is compromise. I can't accept this, but if we can both agree that x and y is better than z, we can start over and see where we go from x and y. (cool album btw, check it out if you haven't already) If you want to get anything done, you must be prepared for things to not shape out 100% how you want them to. If something crucial didn't shape out how you wished for it, you can either find someone else who is prepared to push with you for that one thing (very difficult, not recommended) or put it to one side, think about it some more, and come back when you feel ready to address it again. <br><br><b>Respect the people you're going to work with.</b> It's important to remember that in a chamber or council, everyone is your colleague, not just the people in your party. Everybody is there to do the same job as you, regardless of position or perspective. Politics being the ranked social deduction game that it has become, it's vital that you show respect towards everybody in both your party and in the council as a whole. Besides, the nicer you are to people, the lower the chances are that they'll dig up some dirt on you and try to bring you down. It's a win-win, really -- you're far more likely to gain votes if you're nice to people, and the opposition has less reason to hate you. <br><br><b>Represent the people who got you in there.</b> I'm not talking about the corporations who spend millions of dollars on campaigns, I'm talking about the actual, real people who elect you. Your job in politics should be to represent your constituents. This means that not only do the points above apply to everybody, not just fellow politicians -- you should also keep in mind that once you hold an elected position, your personal views lose priority to the views of your constituents, and the promises you made. Your job is to serve the people. <br><br><b>Be a real person.</b> If you want to do politics, you need to be approachable. As a delegate at basically any level, you should be actively encouraging people to come and talk to you about their concerns, and explaining to them what you can do to fix them. Yes, even as president. If you intend to serve the people, you need to understand the people, and you need to make yourself approachable -- that starts with making yourself not seem like some soulless psychopath who just took up politics as the end goal in a long list of lucrative careers. (i exaggerate, but there really are people like that in the field) You must make it so people are able to talk to you, and feel safe and comfortable doing so. <br><br>To summarise: <b>Do real politics, and do it for real people.</b> You probably saw that one coming, but that's what I want to see, and that's what I'm going to push for as well as I can.
