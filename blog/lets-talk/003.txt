<h2><b>Let's Talk: Why aren't young people politicising? (#003)</h2></b><br><br>
<i>Note: This was written before Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee.</i><br><br>This November, the US will elect their president for the next four years. The results have been clear since March's Super Tuesday: The winner will be the old white man. The old white man will hold his second inauguration speech outside the capitol, and will be attended by his biggest supporters. Albeit, far less than in 2012, for example -- when Barack Obama(1) stood in the same place to do the same thing. The reason for that is quite clear: The old white guy is going to be one of the least popular presidents in American history. <br><br>Neither of the most likely candidates has truly impressed during their respective campaigns, desperately trying to pull the edge voters their way while risking the loss of core voters in the process. Neither candidate has impressed during their respective presidency, either. Most importantly, neither candidate has successfully appealed to the younger generation of voters -- although there's something bigger going on there. You see, Gen Z, that is everyone born between roughly 1998 and 2012, has had some of the lowest participation rates in democracies worldwide. Instead, they prefer to take to the streets -- actions which, usually, are condemned by both active voters and the people said voters elect. They say that such protests are interfering with the democratic process, and that they should let their voice be heard on a ballot instead of on a banner. <br><br>Yet still, so many young people don't even visit the polls, let alone toss a piece of paper into the box. The oldest people of Gen Z are just now 26, meaning we've had a solid eight years -- in my terms, that's two national elections and around 24 national referenda -- to notice this issue, and it's only gotten worse. As the politicians grow older, they fail more and more of the younger generation and their needs. This almost systematic disenfranchising of younger people only amplifies the hopelessness and (arguably more importantly) the distrust among the younger generations in politics as a whole. <br><br>Notice how I describe the disenfranchising of younger people in politics as systematic -- I don't think it takes much to notice that when drafts regarding rent, state pensions and other topics that would affect the various income sources of the older, land-owning population, there's a fairly clear conflict of interest between young and old that begins to build up. Now I don't intend to imply that the older generations are intentionally pushing younger people away from politics, but..... let's just say it isn't impossible. And that it's in the best interests of many older people that the young generation doesn't have their voice be heard in the ballot.<br><br>Between the general hopelessness of many of our lives, a clear conflict of interests and a general failing of today's politics to address any form of sustainable future, it's easy to understand why so many young people just don't see a point in going to the polls on referendum day. Add on top of that the general existential dread we see from climate change, the various wars, genocides and other humanitarian horrors taking place across the world and the absolute state of most "first-world" nations' economies and you start to see why so many people are so terrified of what next year could bring when existence for even another fortnight isn't necessarily guaranteed.<br><br>This November, the US will elect their president for the next four years. The results have been clear since March's Super Tuesday: The winner will be the old white man. The turnout is going to be either shockingly low or surprisingly high, but one thing is clear: The young generation have no viable option that addresses their needs in a sustainable way. The fact that such an option is desperately needed is clear. If it's presented soon enough, and enough trust is built in today's politics for it to succeed? <br><br>We'll have to find out.
