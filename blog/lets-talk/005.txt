<h2><b>Let's Talk: What links Adobe's exploitative subscription service to the Michigan Circuit court? (#005)</h2></b><br><br>The first answer might be that Adobe went to court in Michigan over their subscription services. And while that's by no means correct, it's also not too far off. <br><br>Our story begins in 1919, shortly after the first world war, when the American economy was starting to pick up pace -- the roaring twenties would probably be the closest to the american dream we've ever gotten, before it all fell apart. That, however, is besides the point. You see, in 1919, Ford Motor company had been producing their flagship model T for over a decade, and Henry Ford, the owner, wanted to give something back to his production line workers who made it possible. He announced in 1919 that Ford's dividends that year wouldn't be paid out, and instead reinvested into the company itself to increase wages and expand their production. <br><br>This didn't go down very well with two minor shareholders, namely the Dodge brothers. These brothers would go on to make their own car brand, and do quite well, but that is also besides the story. The Dodge brothers sued Ford, claiming that raising wages and lowering the sales price of the model T -- something they argued was philanthropic -- was not the purpose of a company. Ford disagreed, saying the purpose of a company was to benefit society as a whole, and not just the company's shareholders. It was for this reason he wanted to make the model T as affordable as possible, and ensure his employees got as much pay as they could. The court ultimately ruled in favour of the Dodge brothers, and the decision was appealed to the Michigan supreme court. Again, the ruling was in favour of the Dodge brothers. <br><br>As Ford chose not to raise the issue further, the decision was set: The primary reason of a company's existence is the betterment of its shareholders. Now if you know one thing about court law, I hope it's this: Decisions set precedents across the nation, and sometimes across national borders. Fearing a similar lawsuit, companies across the US (and, in some cases, the world) would proceed to change to a shareholder-oriented model of business, putting dividends and shareholder value above all else. You can probably see where Adobe comes into this by now. <br><br>If we fast-forward a few years, we see that that model hasn't changed much. Corporations continue to extract money from their customers, and redirect it into the pockets of their shareholders. If you read some of the older writeups I did here, you'll notice that this has only gotten more extreme over the last few decades -- products are manufactured to a far lower quality, and are sold at roughly the same price as before. Sometimes even higher, and that's adjusted for inflation. That's because, in order to create a year-over-year profit, companies are forced to make more and more money every year. Some companies even hand out dividends every quarter, which adds even more pressure. <br><br>With all that in mind, the companies are forced to find more ways to make more money than simply selling things. They needed to not only attract new customers, but keep the old ones -- and more importantly, their wallets -- attached so they could keep a return coming from the old customers as well. The way many companies, including Adobe, decided to do this, was to provide their products as a service -- a monthly subscription fee, instead of a lifetime license for that specific version of their product. <br><br>There are a lot of other ways to do this as well. Nespresso, very notably, has proprietary capsules, that only they are allowed to produce. Gillette* used to sell razor handles at a massive markdown, and mark the individual blades up by a large factor. Gyms make it almost impossible to cancel. The list goes on, but the purpose is the same. Companies are being forced to lock their old customers in to their product and their product only, and they're doing this in more ways than you think.<br> <br>So we have companies that are forced to charge you more and more, often a monthly amount, so they can serve their shareholders. Some, like Adobe (and indeed a lot of gyms) take it further: They like to charge a cancellation fee, which is often many times the monthly subscription fee, to merely back out of their business. And that, dear reader, is the link. We go back to 1919, when the Michigan Circuit court and, shortly after, the Michigan supreme court, decided that the primary purpose of a company was to provide the highest possible dividends to the shareholders. <br><br>This single case seems to have had a lot more effect than the Jury and Justices originally thought. Over a century later, almost everything is locked behind some sort of subscription service. YouTube Premium, Netflix, Adobe products, hell, even some carmakers tried to lock some of their features (which, I might add, were already physically present in the car in question) behind a monthly paywall, because that's the most effective way we've found to keep the dividends flowing. <br><br>As always, the answer seems to be capitalism. Or at least, tangentially related to it.<br><br><i>*If I had a nickel for every time Gillette was on the wrong side of history, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't much, but <a href="https://www.si.edu/spotlight/health-hygiene-and-beauty/hair-removal">it's weird that it happened twice.</a></i>
