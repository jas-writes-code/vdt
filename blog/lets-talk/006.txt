<h2><b>Let's Talk: Why do Apple make the same exact thing every year? (#006)</h2></b><br><br>If you watch any of Apple's product events, you'll probably see how they 'invented' so many new features each time. Something which, while this was previously the case, it hasn't been so for many years. I refer you to the time Apple 'innovated' using USB-C on the iPhone, when in reality they were legally mandated to do so by the European Union. <br><br>For a long time, Apple was at the forefront of innovation. I speak of the late 90s and early 2000s, when they would consistently release new computers and laptops, and then finally, the iPhone. This new device would release to immediate success, despite many critics believing otherwise. That being said, the same critics believed SMS and MMS wouldn't work, yet I now write this on one of the many godchildren of those services. The reason so many critics were quite so vocal, however, is the stage that the iPhone -- and, indeed, SMS and MMS systems in their time -- were in.<br><br>Boston Consulting has made this relatively simple to understand so, while I disagree with many of their practices, I think this one makes a lot of sense.<br><br>Every product that is launched enters the market from the top right of the graph below, as a question mark. This means, it is unsure if the product will succeed in the first place. There are a few ways to increase the odds of success, and while I won't explain them here -- no method can garuantee the low-risk high-reward business model that everybody looks for. That comes later. <br><br>If a product fails it goes straight downwards in the graph to become a poor dog. The general advice here is to either remove it from the market outright, or attempt a relaunch with arguably worse odds of success than before. If it succeeds, however, it becomes a star -- this is the up-and-coming of whatever market you choose, which is still taking a lot of investment but is expected to break even very soon, if it hasn't already. At this point, the product is garuanteed some form of success, and the early investors are having their risk handsomely rewarded. Latecomers will also be rewarded, but not as much -- and they must recognise when to withdraw their investments before it's too late.<br><br>Most large companies we know today are in the third stage: The cash cows. This is also where the expression of milking a product or consumer comes from -- the corporation and its investors are now trying to extract as much money as possible from their product, before it loses relevance on the market. I'm sure you're familiar with how they do this, and I suggest you read #005 and #001 for some (but not all) examples if you aren't. <br><br>Eventually, the product will lose relevance and join the poor dogs. As with a flopped product, the options are to either relaunch or remove -- or, given we now have a successful product, a third option exists: Reinvest. Reinvesting can be interpreted as creating a new product, using the profits from its predecessor to design something with similar or better chances at success or, given the last attempt did rather well, simply making the same exact thing again -- with just enough adaptations to make it feel different.<br><br>I'm sure you can see where Apple comes into this.<br><br>What many large companies like to do nowadays is their absolute best to skip the first two parts of the product life-cycle, and get straight to the cash cows, as cash cows is where the profit can be found. They rely on prior success to sell future success, attract investors based on near-infinite profits and equally high promises, and it works. I've spoken to many people who flat-out refuse to switch away from larger companies, despite agreeing that it's probably in their best interests to do so. That's assuming it's possible to make the switch in the first place, which in the case of some companies it simply isn't.<br><br>The problem is that this won't work forever -- and we're starting to see some cracks already. (cont)<br> <br>We've established already that corporations are motivated by shareholder profits, so it's clear that they will continue to exploit the life-cycle to relaunch and reinvest, and extract (milk) more and more money out of the consumer until the breaking point has come and gone. It's a shame to say that I have yet to see a way out of this mess that doesn't involve the regulator, who is bound by their own set of very inconsistent interests.<br><br>So to answer the question at the top, in case it wasn't clear: Because they can. Not only can they make the same thing over and over, but they know that doing so will result in the highest profits with the lowest need for investment. Because innovation, despite being what the world desperately needs, simply costs far too much to be feasible.
