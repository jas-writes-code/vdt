<h2><b>Let's Talk: Hamas doesn't exist. (#008)</h2></b><br><br>I'm writing this on my phone, on a highway somewhere in France. So apologies in advance if this is more disorganized than what you're used to.<br><br>I'm sure by now you've heard about the latest in a long series of atrocities in Gaza that made it to headline news. I'll spare you the details, because you probably know the Israeli military's MO by now -- I'd like to discuss their justification for this "attack".<br><br>Ever since Oct 7th, and arguably before then, Israel has had one main excuse behind which they hide every time a hospital, school, refugee camp or other well-known civilian shelter comes into their sights: Hamas was hiding there. The exact nature varies -- sometimes it's tunnels (why didn't they deploy spec ops?), other times it's human shields (again, spec ops??), occasionally they claim Hamas was holding Gazan civilians hostage (spec ops???), but the point is the same. Hamas was hiding there, so they couldn't possibly deploy skilled fighters on the ground to seek out the hostage-takers and reduce civilian casualties -- something which, assuming the Israeli military is or was previously trained by the SAS or the US Marines, they should know how to do -- they had to carpet bomb the area in question instead to ensure Hamas didn't get out. Of course, if you completely flatten an area, there won't be any life there anymore. <br><br>One of Israel's three goals in Gaza is to eliminate Hamas. The other two are less relevant here, but given how hard Israel is trying, I imagine they're doing just as badly at them as they are in eliminating Hamas. We would argue that they're not even trying to get rid of Hamas, but I'd like to present a different theory.<br><br>Hamas doesn't exist. At least, not in the way Israel imagines it.<br><br>We know Hamas as (depending on your stance on this whole thing) a terrorist organization, a civilian militia, a group of freedom fighters or some cocktail mix of the above. Shaken, not stirred. Israel's perspective, or at least that of their leadership, is different.<br><br>I believe Israel's leadership likes to use the terms "Gazan" and "Hamas" as somewhat of a synonym. Either that, or Hamas is treated like nothing more than an idea -- told from generation to generation, spreading like a disease through every whisper in the Gaza strip.<br><br>It's impossible to truly stomp an idea -- a mere concept -- into the ground without much bloodshed. One might argue that all that is necessary is to make an example out of a few people, but I'd that happens the risk of martyrdom becomes much higher. Therefore, Israel seek to crush the idea of Hamas at the roots. <br><br>Perhaps, given this new definition of Hamas, we might revisit Israel's goals to eliminate it and realise that they are, in fact, incredibly effective. (at least domestically but we all know they dont gaf about foreign pressure anymore)<br><br>We have established, however, that at Israel's definition of Hamas is misleading at best, and a propaganda tool at worst. <br><br>If Israel used the more common (and arguably correct) definition, and used reasonable force to achieve their goal, I am certain this siege would have ended within two weeks. As it is, Israel appears to be certain that Hamas is either a disease in the brains of every Gazan, or that it simply is every Gazan. They therefore seek to eliminate everybody in Gaza, and do so with force far, far beyond what is seen as reasonable.<br><br>Israel seeks to eliminate Hamas, but Hamas doesn't exist -- not how Israel sees it.
