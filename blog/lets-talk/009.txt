<h2><b>Let's Talk: The Debrief. (#009)</h2></b><br><br>I was going to do something else, but current events seem to have taken over. That's fine, it'll wait a couple days.<br><br>I was also going to write two of these yesterday -- one for if Harris won, and one for the current scenario, but didn't really find the time. Whatever.<br><br>So, Don is back. This feels rather strange to be saying, but at the same time I did almost expect it. As well as VP Harris did, she was running on limited time with a very poorly placed dent in her campaign, that being her boss. Try as she might to get away from Biden's reputation and campaign, it was never going to fully work.<br><br>With that in mind, I want to take a look at what's going to happen over the next few years. Some of this will be speculation, and I'll be sure to disclose when that's the case, but the rest is going to be stuff that's basically guaranteed. I refer you to #004 -- it's not great, but I doubt the situation will be as bad as you fear. <br><br>As I write this, Donald Trump has been announced as the election's winner by every news outlet. The count now needs to finish, get certified, and then go up to Congress so they can do the formalities of voting in the new president themselves. That might take a few weeks, and I'm going to be curious to see the exact numbers of votes that went in when they finish. Especially if, in some cases, the vote was split in some states.<br><br>Sooner or later, January will roll around. I imagine this time, it will be a lot more peaceful than the last. You see, Donald's plan was always the same: Claim the election was carried out perfectly if he wins, because that gives him more ammunition against the others. This was the will of the people, and the Democrats can only get into office if they rig the election, and so on, and so forth. I'm sure you can imagine what this would be about.<br><br>If Trump didn't win, I would speculate (although, I'm almost 100% certain about this part) that he would attempt to mount something similar to January 6th again, only this time bigger, earlier, and more organised. He'd claim that the election was rigged, and that it was a lie by the radical left to steal our democracy -- sorry, constitutional republic -- from decent American citizens and transfer it to foreign interests such as Russia and China. You know, the same foreign interests Donald himself is close friends with. <br><br>I'm sure there's a whole nother essay to be written about how both sides of the election think their candidate will not only bring, but also prevent the exact same things. Might do that actually.<br><br>In the sense that another Jan 6th was prevented, I suppose we should count ourselves lucky that Donald won. That, however, may be the end of our luck.<br><br>Trump's policy is no secret. Even if he doesn't implement Project 2025, the Heritage foundation has written a multitude of other documents regarding the first days, weeks and months of Trump's term. The question is, how much of it will he follow through with?<br><br>Trump's policy may not be a secret, but the fact that he's a populist liar isn't much of one either. I wouldn't be surprised if, while many policies are put through, many more are simply left to fall through the cracks and be ignored. That, I'm afraid, is something we'll have to wait and see.<br><br>With a little bit of luck, America will go back to the polls in two years. With even more luck, in four as well. It feels strange to treat that as if it isn't something that will happen anyway, but I fear the guarantee we've previously enjoyed simply isn't there anymore.<br>  <br>Until the return to the polls, the torch is passed back down to the people. It is the job of the American people to find suitable candidates, who are willing to defend the right of everyone to not only exist, but thrive in their own unique way. It is the job of the American people to politicise the next generation, as well as the many, many groups who feel disenfranchised because of their race, heritage, orientation, and really anything else. As far as we know, the state won't be helping this many people for long, so it is the job of the American people to show that they are able to care for each other.<br><br>As bleak as this may seem, I believe the situation can be recovered. It may take a number of years, but I believe it to be possible. However, this requires you -- yes, you -- to get involved. If you're in America, start doing some research. Learn some public speaking, check when your local government meets, and go speak there. Talk to your representatives, and your community. Meet people. Be the person who cares, when nobody else does. <br><br>And don't fuck up again.
