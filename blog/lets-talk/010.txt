<h2><b>Let's Talk: Don't Lose Focus. (#010)</h2></b><br><br>This may be quite interesting, as the two messages I'm trying to get across are as good as polar opposites. Chances are I'll try and find a way to make the two fit together, though.<br><br>Every now and then, something comes up that attracts the attention of almost every corner of the internet. This is usually some sort of social or issue, typically one that has been ongoing for more than anyone cares to remember but only recently made major headlines. The murder of George Floyd sparked this kind of uproar in mid-late 2020, before then one might think about the wildfires in Brazil or the expos√© of China's crimes against humanity in the Xingjiang province. There are, of course, more recent examples, but those are probably obvious enough.<br><br>For most of us, these things tend to come and go. News enters the headlines when it's fresh, and after a while it gets stale -- this has happened for about as long as people have been keeping up with their surroundings, as nobody wants to hear the same things again and again. <br><br>Something I've noticed more recently, though, is that things tend to get stale a lot faster than they did even a few years ago. The reasons for this aren't particularly easy to pin down, although the simple explanation is that the cycle of fresh news has accelerated to fit the human attention span, which has been getting progressively shorter ever since we all spent months on end stuck at home a few years ago. <br><br>Now, news cycles speeding up isn't inherently a bad thing. This isn't going to be a "tiktokification of the internet" essay, as there are already hundreds of those done and frankly it's a plain fucking boring topic to write about. My concern is about the side effect of this faster cycle, which doesn't seem to get quite as much attention. You see, there is a hard limit to how much information the average human brain can process at once. After that, it has to toss out some of the things to make way for new stuff to think about. This, dear reader, is my concern.<br><br>Whenever something big rolls around, like I described earlier, people need to make way for it in their heads. This often results in the last few big things being forgotten, often leading to a less than satisfying result if this happens on a large scale. Support for the Ukranian front line is waning, largely because it's been going on so long that people are sick and tired of hearing about it. Similarly, people forgot George Floyd -- who's name we were all saying only a few weeks prior -- very, very quickly after the news shifted to something else. <br><br>This also isn't a "I support the current thing" essay, because I'm already making an entire three-part documentary on exactly that. I don't think we should ignore a new tragedy, just because the last one isn't over yet. At the same time, however, we absolutely must not shift all our energy to the latest headline that hits our phones (or, for those of you who watch TV news, our TV screens). Our attention and, by extension, energy, should instead be split between the various things going on.<br><br>But, that being said...<br><br>Let's face it. You're human, I'm human. I talked just now about information overload, and what happens if your brain can't process everything.<br><br>You only have a very fixed amount of fucks to give. You physically can not care about every single thing that goes on in the world. For Christ's sake, there are nine billion people on earth. There will always be something happening, and there will always be the next tragedy on the evening news. <br> <br>I don't want to invalidate anything, because everybody's struggles are valid. Especially those that do make it to headline news. There is so much going on that, even if you barely look at the news, you'll catch on to a lot more than you first expected and eventually, something has to give. Because you only have so many fucks to give.<br><br>A portion of your energy must go towards your own wellbeing. It's important to remember, especially when so much of your attention is demanded by a six-inch OLED display, that your own wellbeing has to go first. You'll be a quivering wreck if you fail at that step, which makes you useless when your attention is needed elsewhere. <br><br>Another portion of your energy should go towards your immediate surroundings. Are your friends and family well? Do they need you or your help for something? Who do you want to meet up with in the next few days or weeks? What about that project you were working on, and really want to finish? These are the things you have direct control over, and so the things that should be taking up the biggest part of your energy after self-care. <br><br>The last few fucks are yours to hand out how you see fit. As explained, I suggest you use them very wisely, and not spend them all at once. There are a lot of things to care about, and I advise you try and split your attention between them. You can't lose focus on Gaza and Ukraine, just because some major news made its way to you from Sudan. Similarly, you can't just ignore Sudan because Gaza and Ukraine are still happening.<br><br>You have a very limited amount of fucks to give.<br><br>Give them wisely.
