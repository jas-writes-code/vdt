<h1>Life is defined in Death.</h1>
<p>Bit of philosophy for you today. </p>
<p>Every now and then, an AI company takes more steps towards achieving AGI. This is Artificial General Intelligence, and while there&#39;s no definition that&#39;s been universally agreed upon, most people agree it&#39;s an AI that is capable of passing the Turing test, which is when language experts attempt to distinguish a conversation between an AI and a human.</p>
<p>When this eventually happens -- I say if, not when, as we seem to be moving closer towards such a stage by the day -- the question of personhood will be raised again. Some will say that the AGI is inherently alive and a person, and so must be granted the same rights. Others will claim on the basis of &quot;soul&quot; and &quot;humanity&quot; that the AGI is neither. I&#39;d like to present something else.</p>
<p>When you remove the power from a computer, without saving your things, it can be turned back on and you can finish up a few hours behind where you left off. In most cases, unless the CNMOS battery dies or the UEFI corrupts or whatever. This isn&#39;t a computer science lesson, so I won&#39;t teach one. Anything left in RAM is lost, but anything that you saved to disk will be kept (as far as we know) indefinitely. It&#39;s possible to start it back up, and use it again. The process is reversible.</p>
<p>Basic system administration says that you should regularly restart your servers to prevent memory overflows and ensure any patches made during the day are installed properly. That and the principle of redundancy is a part of the reason why datacenters are so large -- You need a vast amount of computers to handle the usual traffic, but you also need a number on standby for when something goes wrong, or a server is restarting. This especially applies to AI servers, which handle even larger amounts of computational power. OpenAI hasn&#39;t disclosed exactly how many instances of ChatGPT they run, but I&#39;d estimate it&#39;s well into the thousands. These would need to periodically back up everything they learn to the training set, which would in turn be backed up and maintained just how one would expect. Including restarts, a reversible process of removing power from a computer in a controlled fashion.</p>
<p>Some may describe the process of &quot;pulling the plug&quot; on an AGI as murder. I would disagree, simply because the AGI is not dead in the same was a living being can be. The AGI was never alive.</p>
<p>Death is defined as the irreversable cessation of one of the three core bodily functions. These are brain activity, breathing and heartbeat. The reason it&#39;s only one of these is because any living being <em>must</em> have all three intact to survive -- if any one of the three shuts down, the others will do the same in a matter of minutes. The reason it&#39;s irreversible may also be clear -- If a person is pronounced dead, the doctors can try as they might, but there is no possibility of resuscitation.</p>
<p>As much as we have turned death into a social construct, with funerals and eulogies and cremations and the other things, the fact remains that it can not be reversed. Once dead, as much as I may want it with some people, one can not be brought back to life. It is this distinction that separates us, that are alive, from that which is not. When living beings die, it is a permanent process that can&#39;t be reversed. Given that the AGI runs on a computer, the act of &quot;killing&quot; it is reversible -- the AGI can not die, therefore it was never alive.</p>
<p>I say this because life is defined by the ability to die. It is defined by an amount of time in which one is here, and able to experience the beauty of our world. Life is to be enjoyed, as it will not last forever.</p>
<p>To claim that an AGI is &quot;alive&quot; is, therefore, at best misleading. It feels like the sort of claim a corporate CMO would make to push Their(tm) AI above the competition. A cash-grab. Legally, that claim brings many more issues with it, such as the question of citizenship. Should an AGI be given a passport? How can you possibly say a &quot;living, breathing&quot; computer is equal to a human being? The AGI may consider itself to be superior to those who created it -- how should one go about that?</p>
<p>These are all questions that, if a AGI is considered to be alive, must be considered.</p>
<p>The AGI, however, is incapable of dying, therefore it is not alive.</p>
<p>Robots do not deserve human rights.</p>
