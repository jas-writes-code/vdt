  <p><b>The Concept</b><br><br>
  Let's Talk is a project I started in March-ish of 2024, and have occasionally updated since then. It's a series of write-ups, usually roughly the length of three max-size discord messages, about something that I've found interesting or worth talking about in the days before I write it.<br><br>
  The purpose isn't to convince somebody of a certain opinion, or shut down a discussion -- quite the opposite. Let's Talk is created with the intention of starting a discussion on a certain topic, providing a stable basis for anybody reading something to talk about the topic either with me, or with others who might be interested.<br><br>
  Why did I choose three max-length discord messages as a guideline length? Truth be told, I'm not quite sure why I'm sticking to it, apart from the fact that it seems to work quite well. Six thousand characters is enough to get around a thousand words into each, which is enough to explain a topic or an opinion to a nuance that just isn't available on something like twitter.<br><br>
  I'm doing this to break free from the restrictions of 280 characters -- around 40 words -- per opinion that Twitter allows you without paying Elon, which simply isn't enough to meaningfully explain what you think about something.</div>
  <h2><b>Archive</b></h2>
  <p>Every write-up I create will be archived here. The latest is shown automatically, but you can select any of them to read.</p><br>
