          <p>Hey. It's Virgil. All the pronouns.<br>This is where I talk about some of the projects I<a href = "./blog">'</a>ve worked on.</p>
          <p class = small>I'm slowly getting better at code, so I'm learning how to make the site look decent. Wish me luck, I'll need it.</p>

    <p>Hosting this website is part of a project itself, which I'm writing more about <a href = "./blog/oldpcsaga">here</a>.<br><br>
    
    I make videos when I can. A few of my personal creations are on my <a href = https://www.youtube.com/@virgildoesthings/videos>Youtube</a>, but there's a lot of stuff I don't post to there.<br><br>
    Every now and then, I create a small write-up on something that I think is worth talking about. It's sort of a cross between a column and an explainer, with a little speech-writing tossed in when it fits. <a href="blog/lets-talk">Let's Talk</a> is intended to open a discussion about the topic I'm writing about, be it with me or someone else entirely.<br><br>
    A lot of the projects I work on are made for or in cooperation with some cool people in some <a href = "./blog/discord">discord servers</a> I'm in. Check them out, or don't, I don't really mind.<br><br>
    Believe it or not, I have actually been writing some code. I'm quite happy with it, so maybe you'll like it too. Or not. It's not exactly complex. Still, have a look at it <a href = "./code">here</a> if you want.
