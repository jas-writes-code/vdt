    <strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>
The Internet is one of the greatest creations of the 20th Century, connecting people across the globe and allowing access to a near infinite amount of knowledge. As the Millennium came and went, it became evident to the world’s technology producers that this new technology was profitable like nothing that had come before it, and so they did the thing every company would do, when Dollar signs of this size appear in its eyes: Create opportunities to profit off the internet.<br><br>
For many years, this was close to a non-issue. Business ethics were kept intact, such that the internet was made not only more profitable but also more convenient to use. As we live on today, we see the Internet become more and more profitable, but these days the concept of convenience is often overlooked. Profitability has become more and more important, to the extent that the user experience is often sacrificed. Let’s be honest - you can’t go a week without finding a blog post that just doesn’t feel natural, pumped full of search engine optimised terms and language that feels so well-rounded and inhuman that it was probably written by an AI. Usually, you’re also offered the opportunity to register for a free or paid subscription to these sites. If you choose not to do so, the likely case is that you are shown so many adverts that it almost becomes tempting to dig into your pockets.<br><br>
If you do decide to get out your credit card and pay up, or even register for free with your username and password (although most sites will also ask for a phone number and email verification these days), you free yourself from the adverts in return for something infinitely more valuable: Your personal information. Of course, a profit has to be generated somehow. By giving out your details in the sign-up window, you add your name to a list of people who are signed up to, and by extension are interested in whatever you signed up for. This list can be sold for a lot of money to advertisers, who in turn advertise their content on sites with similar traffic, hoping to generate a profit of their own.<br><br>
In other words: If a service is free, your data and your behaviour is the product. Behaviour tracking has become so advanced that sites are able to track your mouse movements and scroll activity on a site, reading what content you show an interest in and adding that to their database. This especially applies if a service is not only free, but also free of adverts. Just from writing this introduction in Google Docs, my browser has blocked over three thousand trackers. <br><br>
In a digital world, it’s easy to say that advertisers know more about you than you know about yourself. And yes, tracking across accounts and emails has been possible for years. If that’s a shock to you, it really shouldn’t be. If you don’t like the way the Internet is going, perhaps this Manifesto is for you. It’s split up into three main sections, which outline why I believe if the Internet is to continue to prosper, it must be reformed.</p></div>

<div class="toast"><p><strong>Create more; Consume less</strong><br><br>
We live in a world where endless content is readily available to be enjoyed from our mobile phones, devices which we likely won’t go more than ten metres away from for the rest of our lives. The content we consume is curated and organised to our interests by an algorithm which, in many cases, completely removes any element of choice we have over what we choose to watch. The content we are given is given with the specific intent of keeping us on the platform as long as possible because the longer a user spends, the more profitable they are. On platforms such as Snapchat and Youtube, the majority of this content is also created by a large corporation. This completely removes any sense of connection between the user and the creator and reduces them to nothing but a consumer, with no hope of creating their own content.<br><br>
<i>I reject this model.</i> I reject it because I believe that people not only can, but should create their own content. Let their minds wander. Do that art they wanted to, make that song. In a world where consuming endless content for the sake of happy brain chemicals has become the norm, I find myself encouraging more and more people to take some time to create what their mind can think of. People seem to forget what the human mind is capable of, and scrolling for too long can leave you feeling significantly worse than when you started.<br><br> 
The simple deduction from that is that, very simply, spending time scrolling endless content is unhealthy, both for the mind and for the body. As such, it is my belief that consumption should be reduced to make way for creation. <br><p class="tiny">Perhaps I should clarify here, that you should by no means stop consuming content altogether, but simply put more focus towards creating your own things instead. The Elitism that is prevalent throughout much of the modern web is another factor that actively discourages creation, out of fear that you don’t succeed the first time.</p>
By creating content, you stimulate the brain in a way that consumption can not achieve. You allow the mind to wander, and the body to create something original and beautiful. Creating is one of the healthiest things you can do, and for the reasons described above, I don’t think people currently do enough of it.<br><br> Allowing your mind to think of something new actively improves your cognitive ability, and your mental health. It allows you to further understand yourself and what you like, and - who knows - it might just make you some money off of it.
Money is an important topic here, though: As you’ve probably figured from the Introduction, the main reason creation is so discouraged over consumption on the main web is simply because it’s not profitable for the companies that own the platforms you use. Don’t let that stop you.</div>
