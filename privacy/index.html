    Through the provision of my services, which include, but are not limited to the below list, there is a possibility that I collect any amount of personal data. This policy will explain what I will collect from what service, and how I will treat and process the data I collect.
</p><br>
    
    <h1>Where I collect data from</h1>
    <p><ul>
    <li>Administrative services and system operation
    <li>Filmmaking and/or journalism
    <li>Community management
    <li>Secretarial assistance
    <li>Cloud hosting
    <li>Code hosting
    </ul>
    And others. Data from these may also be collected passively; with no intention to gather, hoard or farm user data. </p>
    <br>
    <h1>What I do with user data</h1>
    <p>Absolutely nothing.<br>
    Any and all user data I collect is treated with the highest level of confidentiality and respect. Under no circumstances will I share this data with a third party, nor make any attempt to make a profit from said data. <br>
    Artificial Intelligence crawlers are prohibited from accessing this website; any data you provide me with will not be used for Artificial Intelligence training.<br>
    Data will be retained only for as long as strictly necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. Any data that outlives its lifespan as described here is deleted from my systems, or anonymised in cases where deletion is not possible.<br>
    The same rules apply in the event I passively; i.e. unintentionally acquire any user data.<br></p>
    
    <h1>If in doubt</h1>
    <p>Contact me. I'll be happy to explain any questions or concerns you may have.<br>
    Please note that by using any of the above described services, or any others that I may offer, I will assume your agreement to this policy. Further note that I reserve the right to change the wording or contents of this policy at any time to better reflect my practices.<br>
